SDK Contents:

The SDK folder contains the files necessary to add the RomoSDK to your
Android application. You can simply add the com.romotive.library package
and the libs folder to your project folder and start controlling your Romo.

The SDKDemo Folder contains a sample project that shows you exactly 
how to use the RomoSDK in your application.

The Documentation folder contains auto-generated Javadoc for the RomoSDK,
including the Sample App. Open up index.html with your browser to read
through it.

Enjoy!
